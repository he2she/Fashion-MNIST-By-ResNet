# Overview
This is just a example to train Fashion-MNIST by Residual Network (ResNet) for learning TensorFlow 2.0.

# Description
* This is an assignment of [Deep Learning basic class](https://deeplearning.jp/lectures/dlb2018/) arranged a little. 
* Training Fashion-MNIST by ResNet on Google Colaboratory with TensorFlow 2.0 Alpha.
* Data is augmented by ImageDataGenerator of Keras.

# Attention
Fashion-MNIST-by-CNN-with-data-augmentation.ipynb file can not be opened correctly, I'm not sure about the reason though. However, you can see the code in Google Colaboratory. So please take a look at [How-to-open-ipynb-on-Google-Colaboratory](https://github.com/shoji9x9/How-to-open-ipynb-on-Google-Colaboratory) and open it in Google Colaboratory.

# Dataset
